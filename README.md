# vimrc

I know the repo name is vim, but this does a little more than that.

It pretty much used to setup my vim, virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper (because I'mlazy). It also downloads and sets up
gitaware promt, a little tool I've come to love. 

## Installation
'''
cd /path/to/vimrc # The folder containing this file
chmod +x setup
./setup
'''

This should clone the necessary repos, create the necessary directories and move and edit necessary files.
